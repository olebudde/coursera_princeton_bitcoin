My solutions to the assignments

You should not copy the assignments, but use them as hints when you are struggling. 

The first and third assigments are not really hard, but difficult because the assignment submission feedback does not give you any feedback at all. (Except for the stuff you output to stderr when you make the application crash)

For the second I went with a surprisingly trivial attempt that passed, although not with highscore. Did not learn much about bayesian statistics from that one.
